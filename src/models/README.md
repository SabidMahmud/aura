# models/

This directory contains all data models and business logic for the Aura app. It includes:

- **Prisma schemas** for database tables (User, Metric, Tag, ActionLog, DailyRating, Insight)
- TypeScript types and validation logic
- Any model-level business rules

These models map directly to the core data requirements in the PRD, supporting user accounts, logging, ratings, and insights.
