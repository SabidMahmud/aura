# controllers/

This directory contains route handlers, API endpoints, and server actions for Aura.

Controllers mediate between the UI (views), models, and services, handling requests such as:
- User authentication (NextAuth.js)
- Logging actions and ratings
- Fetching and saving insights

Controllers implement the backend logic required by the PRD's user stories.
